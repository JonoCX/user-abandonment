# User Abandonment in Interactive Media

This repository contains the notebooks, models, and data associated with my PhD thesis chapter on abandonment. 

All of the data needed to run the notebooks is included with the repository. However, as the data captured directly from the system is too large to include in a GitHub repository, please download them from these links and put them into the `data` folder:

* [Self-driving cars substory data](https://figshare.manchester.ac.uk/account/articles/18702719)
* [Technology use in Malawi substory data](https://figshare.manchester.ac.uk/account/articles/18703472)

To run the notebooks, you'll first need to create the necessary virtual environment and install the required libraries (use either venv (`requirements.txt`) or conda (`environment.yml`))

**This is an active repository, with tweaks and slight changes being made as we turn the chapter into a paper. To get the version used in the thesis, then please download the release.**

## Reference
If you use the work and/or data, then please reference us using the Zenodo link (and hopefully paper reference).
